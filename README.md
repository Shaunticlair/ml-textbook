If you are looking for the textbook itself, you will find it in the "chapter pdfs" folder. Source .tex files are stored in the "chapters" folder.

This is the machine learning textbook I am developing in collaboration with MIT's 6.3900 staff. I'm placing this in a secondary repo so I can share it with friends and other who may be interested.

The goal of this text is to be as easily understood as possible, with the complete willingness to sacrifice concision or elegance for that purpose. If there are any apparent errors, or something that seems at all confusing, feel free to contact me!
